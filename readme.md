# Data Engineer Skills Assessment - EVC

Thank you for the opportunity to participate in this assigment for the Data Engineer position at Everybody Votes
Campaign (EVC)!

In this repository you will find the development of the assigment for which 
I developed a Jupyter Notebook for the first point and two markdown files for the second and third points. The links are below:

## [01 data wrangling](01_data_warangling_solution.ipynb)
## [02 sql queries solution](02_sql_queries_solution.md)
## [03 data engineer concepts solution](03_data_engineer_concepts_solution.md)

_**Unfortunately, time is a bit short and I had some connection issues using SQLPAD. 
I would have liked to structure with classes, functions and tests to take better 
advantage of the code for future needs.**_ 

### For now I hope to meet your expectations and say goodbye for now not before giving thanks again for this opportunity.
